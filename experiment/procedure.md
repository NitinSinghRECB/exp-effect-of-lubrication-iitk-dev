### Procedure

**Step 1:** Select the material specimen you want to test (pin and disc).  

**Step 2:** Clean the specimen to remove any dirt or grease.  

**Step 3:** Apply the chosen lubricant:  
- For boundary film lubrication, apply a thin layer of grease or oil.  
- For hydrodynamic lubrication, apply a thicker layer or continuous oil flow.  

**Step 4:** Fix the pin firmly in the holder of the wear testing machine.  

**Step 5:** Place the disc on the rotating shaft of the machine.  

**Step 6:** Set the load on the pin (for example, 10 N) using the load control button.  

**Step 7:** Choose the rotation speed of the disc (e.g., 25 rpm or 50 rpm).  

**Step 8:** Start the machine to begin the wear test for a fixed time or sliding distance.  

**Step 9:** After the test, stop the machine and remove the specimens.  

**Step 10:** Clean and weigh the pin and disc to find weight loss (wear).  

**Step 11:** Use the results button or record the wear values and friction data.  

**Step 12:** Repeat the test with different lubricants and compare results.
